I enjoy customizing every aspect of my system. This repository contains my
complete setup â€” from configuration files for the tools I use (managed through
symlinks) to the declarative configuration of my entire system using the Nix
package manager, language, and operating system.

If youâ€™re just getting started, feel free to use my setup (_I donâ€™t mind_ â€” see
the [LICENSE][license]). But for your own good, **take the time to read through
it**. You won't get the most out of it otherwise.

## ðŸ§© Overview

This configuration is as modular as I can make it. Itâ€™s split into two main
directories:

- `home/`: portable configuration that works across any Linux distribution. Many
modules even work on macOS, except for platform-specific ones like GNOME or
Hyprland.

- `system/`: NixOS-specific configuration, containing only whatâ€™s truly
necessary for the system layer (at least I try to).

Every folder in `home/programs/*` is a module that brings the option
`dotfiles.programs.<name>.enable` and can be activated or deactivated but commenting
or setting it to `false`. Complex setups can easily be built by composing and
reusing these modular pieces.

## ðŸš€ Installing

> [!WARNING]
> Helper scripts are available in the bin/ directory.
> **Read them before running anything** â€” as always, never execute code you donâ€™t
understand or trust.

Start by cloning my `dotfiles` into `~/.dotfiles`. You should do the same with
my `spells` repository. The spells are not a requirement but there's a lot of
goodies there.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nelsonmestevao/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/nelsonmestevao/spells   ~/.spells
```

The only requirement would be to have NixOS or Nix package manager installed.
Then you are ready to build this configuration for your system.

```shell
bin/rebuild (home | os)
```

More documentation will be provided on exactly how to customize things.
